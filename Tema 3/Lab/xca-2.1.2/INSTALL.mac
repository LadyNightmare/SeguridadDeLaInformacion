This is a short overview of how to build
XCA for MAC OSX

Please drop me a mail if you experience problems.

 - Create a base directory "xca" and change into it
 - unpack xca here
 - download and install Qt5 in your home directory
 - edit xca-2.0.1/misc/build-mac.sh and adapt the QTDIR path
   to point to your Qt5 installation path
 - create an empty file "build-libs"
 - execute xca-2.0.1/misc/build-mac.sh
   This will download and compile openssl and libltdl and then compile xca
